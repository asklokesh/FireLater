# FireLater Autonomous Development

## Priority Queue
- [x] STABILITY: Hardcoded proxy trust configuration `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` - TRUST_ALL_PROXIES=true in production creates security vulnerability and deployment instability
- [x] TEST: Auth routes missing comprehensive test coverage `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` - no tests for rate limiting, IP validation, or tenant validation logic
- [x] PERF: Missing database indexing strategy in reporting routes `backend/src/routes/reporting.ts` - complex queries on large datasets will cause performance degradation
- [x] SECURITY: Weak tenantSlug validation in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` - regex allows hyphens at start/end which may lead to injection vulnerabilities
- [x] SECURITY: Insecure IP validation in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` - regex patterns in `isValidIP()` don't properly validate IPv4/v6 ranges, allowing potential IP spoofing attacks
- [x] STABILITY: No circuit breaker pattern implemented for external cloud integration calls, risking cascading failures during provider outages (`backend/src/routes/integrations.ts`).
- [x] TEST: Auth routes lack unit tests for rate limiting and tenant validation logic. Add test coverage for login, register, and reset password endpoints (`backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`).
- [x] PERF: Missing database query indexing strategy for multi-tenant schema lookups may cause performance degradation as tenant count increases. Add composite indexes on tenant_id columns across core tables (`backend/src/routes/*.ts`).
- [x] BUG: Tenant slug regex in `/login` route incorrectly rejects valid single-character slugs due to missing match group. Revise regex to properly handle all valid cases (`backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`).
- [x] SECURITY: Rate limit key generation in `/login` route uses `x-forwarded-for` header without validation, potentially allowing IP spoofing. Consider adding trusted proxy configuration or stricter header validation (`backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`).
- [x] STABILITY: Background job processing with BullMQ lacks proper error handling and retry mechanisms for failed cloud integration sync operations.
- [x] TEST: No unit tests found for critical authentication routes in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` - only basic route registration tests exist.
- [x] PERF: Missing database query indexing strategy for multi-tenant schema-per-tenant architecture could cause performance degradation as tenant count increases.
- [x] BUG: Tenant slug validation regex in `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` incorrectly rejects valid single-character tenant identifiers due to missing capture groups.
- [x] SECURITY: Rate limiting key generator in `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` uses `x-forwarded-for` header without validation, potentially allowing IP spoofing. Should validate and sanitize header value.
- [x] REFACTOR: Duplicate rate limiting configuration across /login, /register, and /reset-password routes should be abstracted into shared middleware - backend/src/routes/auth.ts
- [x] TEST: No unit tests for critical auth routes including registration and password reset - backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts
- [x] PERF: No database connection pooling configuration shown for PostgreSQL - backend/src/config/database.ts
- [x] BUG: Missing input validation for tenantSlug in login route allows potential injection attacks - backend/src/routes/auth.ts
- [x] SECURITY: Rate limiting key generation uses `req.socket.remoteAddress` which can be spoofed; should use `request.ip` or `request.headers['x-forwarded-for']` - backend/src/routes/auth.ts
- [x] REFACTOR: Workflow route has duplicated business logic that should be extracted to shared services (`backend/src/routes/workflow.ts`)
- [x] STABILITY: Oncall schedule rotation logic doesn't handle timezone transitions properly (`backend/src/routes/oncall.ts`)
- [x] PERF: Knowledge base search queries lack proper indexing strategy and pagination (`backend/src/routes/knowledge.ts`)
- [x] BUG: Missing input validation for critical parameters in reporting routes may cause SQL injection (`backend/src/routes/reporting.ts`)
- [x] SECURITY: Rate limiting key generators are vulnerable to IP spoofing via headers like X-Forwarded-For in auth routes (`backend/src/routes/auth.ts`)
- [x] REFACTOR: Workflow routes contain duplicated validation logic for request approval states; extract to shared utility functions in `backend/src/routes/workflow.ts`
- [x] STABILITY: Oncall rotation logic doesn't handle timezone transitions during daylight saving time changes; add timezone-aware date handling in `backend/src/routes/oncall.ts`
- [x] PERF: Knowledge base routes perform N+1 queries when fetching articles with categories; implement proper JOIN queries or batch loading in `backend/src/routes/knowledge.ts`
- [x] BUG: Missing error handling for database connection failures in reporting routes; add proper try/catch blocks and fallback responses in `backend/src/routes/reporting.ts`
- [x] SECURITY: Auth routes lack input validation for tenantSlug which could lead to tenant enumeration attacks; add strict validation and rate limiting per tenant in `backend/src/routes/auth.ts`
- [x] AUDIT: Security audit of authentication flow in backend/src/routes/auth.ts
- [x] AUDIT: Check SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries
- [x] AUDIT: Review error handling across API endpoints
- [x] STABILITY: Add input validation to all API endpoints
- [x] TEST: Add unit tests for critical business logic
- [x] PERF: Optimize slow database queries
- [x] SECURITY: Implement rate limiting
- [x] UX: Improve error messages
