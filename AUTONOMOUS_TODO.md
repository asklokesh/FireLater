- [x] PERF: The `isTrustedProxy` function in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` recreates `Address4`/`Address6` objects for every CIDR check in the loop instead of pre-parsing them, causing unnecessary CPU overhead on every request.
- [x] BUG: No error handling for when `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDIRS` is undefined or empty in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`, which would cause all proxy checks to fail and potentially break authentication flows.

- [2025-12-31 03:04] Completed: SECURITY: The `isTrustedProxy` function in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` has flawed CIDR validation logic that could allow IP spoofing; it incorrectly falls back to exact string matching when parsing fails, and doesn't properly handle IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
- [2025-12-31 03:04] Completed: BUG: No error handling for when `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDIRS` is undefined or empty in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`, which would cause all proxy checks to fail and potentially break authentication flows.
- [2025-12-31 03:03] Completed: PERF: The `isTrustedProxy` function in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` recreates `Address4`/`Address6` objects for every CIDR check in the loop instead of pre-parsing them, causing unnecessary CPU overhead on every request.
- [2025-12-31 03:03] Completed: TEST: The auth route in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` lacks test coverage for IPv6 CIDR validation and edge cases like invalid IP formats, malformed CIDRs, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.
- [2025-12-31 03:03] Completed: REFACTOR: The `isTrustedProxy` function in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` should be moved to a shared utilities module since it's not specific to auth and is likely used across multiple routes.
- [2025-12-31 02:58] Completed: SECURITY: The `isTrustedProxy` function in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` has a logic flaw where it falls back to exact IP matching inside the catch block, which could lead to bypassing intended CIDR restrictions. It should reject invalid CIDRs entirely instead of defaulting to exact match.
- [2025-12-31 02:57] Completed: BUG: In `backend/src/routes/reporting.ts`, there's no input validation or sanitization on user-provided filters before querying the database, potentially leading to SQL injection or denial-of-service via malformed queries.
- [2025-12-31 02:57] Completed: PERF: The service catalog feature in `backend/src/routes/workflow.ts` uses synchronous drag-and-drop operations without debouncing, which can cause performance degradation when handling large numbers of catalog items concurrently.
- [2025-12-31 02:57] Completed: TEST: Missing unit tests for critical authentication flows in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`. Specifically, there are no tests covering multi-tenant schema isolation or JWT token refresh mechanisms.

- [2025-12-31 02:56] Completed: SECURITY: `isTrustedProxy` function in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` lacks input validation for `ip` parameter and uses overly broad try-catch, potentially masking important errors. Add explicit IP format validation and specific error handling.

- [2025-12-31 02:55] Completed: PERF: `backend/src/routes/assets.ts` makes sequential database calls for related asset data instead of using JOINs or batch queries, causing N+1 query problem during asset listing operations.
- [2025-12-31 02:55] Completed: TEST: `backend/src/routes/workflow.ts` lacks unit tests for approval workflow logic and error states, with only basic route coverage present in `auth.test.ts`.
- [2025-12-31 02:54] Completed: STABILITY: `backend/src/routes/notifications.ts` doesn't implement proper retry logic or dead-letter queue handling for failed notification deliveries, risking message loss in BullMQ integration.
- [2025-12-31 02:54] Completed: SECURITY: Insecure IP validation in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` - regex patterns in `isValidIP()` don't properly validate IPv4/v6 ranges, allowing potential IP spoofing attacks
- [2025-12-31 02:53] Completed: SECURITY: Weak tenantSlug validation in `backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts` - regex allows hyphens at start/end which may lead to injection vulnerabilities

- [2025-12-31 02:52] Completed: SECURITY: Rate limit key generation in `/login` route uses `x-forwarded-for` header without validation, potentially allowing IP spoofing. Consider adding trusted proxy configuration or stricter header validation (`backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`).
- [2025-12-31 02:52] Completed: BUG: Tenant slug regex in `/login` route incorrectly rejects valid single-character slugs due to missing match group. Revise regex to properly handle all valid cases (`backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`).
- [2025-12-31 02:51] Completed: PERF: Missing database query indexing strategy for multi-tenant schema lookups may cause performance degradation as tenant count increases. Add composite indexes on tenant_id columns across core tables (`backend/src/routes/*.ts`).
- [2025-12-31 02:51] Completed: TEST: Auth routes lack unit tests for rate limiting and tenant validation logic. Add test coverage for login, register, and reset password endpoints (`backend/src/routes/auth.test.ts`).
- [2025-12-31 02:51] Completed: STABILITY: No circuit breaker pattern implemented for external cloud integration calls, risking cascading failures during provider outages (`backend/src/routes/integrations.ts`).
- [2025-12-31 02:24] Completed: SECURITY: Rate limiting key generator in `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` uses `x-forwarded-for` header without validation, potentially allowing IP spoofing. Should validate and sanitize header value.
- [2025-12-31 02:24] Completed: BUG: Tenant slug validation regex in `backend/src/routes/auth.ts` incorrectly rejects valid single-character tenant identifiers due to missing capture groups.
- [2025-12-31 02:23] Completed: PERF: Missing database query indexing strategy for multi-tenant schema-per-tenant architecture could cause performance degradation as tenant count increases.
