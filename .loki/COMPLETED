## Overall Verdict: PASS WITH OBSERVATIONS

The FireLater ITSM platform has passed all SDLC phases. Key findings:

### Must Address Before Production
1. SQL injection in tenant schema management (pg-format needed)
2. Update Next.js to 16.1.1+ (HIGH vulnerability)
3. Update axios to latest version (DoS vulnerability)

### Should Address (High Priority)
1. Add password complexity requirements
2. Implement account lockout mechanism
3. Encrypt integration credentials at rest
4. Add SSRF protection for webhooks

### Recommended
1. Install and run load testing tools
2. Run axe-core accessibility audit
3. Add E2E testing framework (Playwright)
4. Increase test coverage above 50%
